Digital computing platforms, from sensors to 
supercomputers, are vital for many branches of research and innovation.
Advancement and investments in these technologies have the potential to drive 
transformational change in the frontiers of knowledge through enhanced 
productivity, yet if and only if sufficient expertise is available to
translate scientific ambition into technical solutions. These skills are a core 
element of the Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) besides racks and staff.

Digital Research Technology Professionals (RTPs), whether working exclusively or 
combined with academic roles on infrastructure, whether centralised or embedded, 
are positioned at the intersection of research and infrastructure technology 
and are critical to this endeavour: they lead software development, system design, deployment
and workflow/user environment management to accelerate scientific discovery. Their role is
becoming increasingly challenging as systems become multifaceted, tailored, 
heterogeneous and accelerated, driven both by the end of Dennard scaling and net Zero 
goals: The UK science communities need, will need and start to invest into customised solutions
instead of off-the-shelf, generic infrastructure centralised in one place.

For RTPs to be effective, they must be able to draw upon deep technical 
knowledge, horizon scan for new developments, navigate research and service 
delivery models and develop strong professional skills to advocate and 
implement changes across diverse research domains and their home 
institutions. This knowledge landscape is diverse, ever-increasing and 
-changing through technological advancements, research ambition and the 
applicability within new areas. Despite their critical role, the
number of RTPs per institution remains low, with support for professional development heavily 
reliant upon grassroots activities among RTPs and initiatives by vendors. This
is not long-term sustainable.

SHAREing will establish a virtual centre that supports RTPs to accelerate 
science through the transition of large-scale 
compute- and data-intensive workflows into the era of accelerated compute.
Focusing predominantly on the required skills, training, and the sharing of
expertise, material and core initiatives, it hence will 
deliver a talented workforce with core competencies for 
accelerated research computing environments.
SHAREing will

- foster a knowledge ecosystem in which RTPs and other stakeholders can assess and prototype promising projects that benefit from accelerated solutions. It advocates for the best software-hardware combination for the best science.
- establish structured training including upskilling pathways, such that RTPs can acquire all skills to deliver successful projects, engage in continuous professional development, and establish a career in the field.
- showcase how RTPs' interventions enable significant research innovation due to their influence, pioneering applications to new domains or pushing boundaries in areas already exploiting the latest machinery.

Inclusivity, accessibility and a science-centred ethos will be core to SHAREing, encouraging 
open-mindedness and encouraging critical thinking, respectful that there is 
often no single `right way' when operating at the forefront of technology and
research.

Knowledge exchange, stakeholder engagement and capacity building will be structured in a way that benefits the DRI and UK research and innovation in the broadest possible sense.
A close collaboration with national, European and international initiatives will 
strengthen its impact and branding and establish the UK as 
international lighthouse of a holistic DRI approach.
