## Context

In 2025, we have launched a series of events under the DRI's HAI-End project to discuss with digital research professionals how they would address performance analysis challenges given to them as a black-box.
Colleagues from industry and tool vendors joined these meetings.
The HAI-End consortium collected all outcomes and distilled them into a joint workbook, which we make available through SHAREing.
