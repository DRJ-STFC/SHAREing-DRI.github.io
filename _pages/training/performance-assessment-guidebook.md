## Context

As part of the HAI-End project, we have created revision material to support our training events.
This revision material is used today within Durham's undergrad and postgrad teaching, while a more elaborate version including exercises and revision material will be available from the DiRAC training academy soon.
For the time being, SHAREing hosts this material, and we use it as support material throughout our events:
Whenever participants find out that they lack some (very) basic terminology or concepts, we refer them to these mini-lectures to ensure that everybody is on the same pages.
